```javascript
  // Creating an AJAX call for specific city's weather

        $.ajax({

            url: queryURL,

            method: "GET",

            // error function to validate user input to textbox

            error: function () {
                alert("city not found enter another city");
                deleteBtn();
            }

        }).then(function (response) {



            // fetch api data and convert to variables
            let cityName = response.city.name;
            let Date = response.list[0].dt_txt;
            let today = moment(Date).format('MMMM Do, YYYY');
            let temperature = response.list[0].main.temp;
            let humidity = response.list[0].main.humidity;
            let windSpeed = response.list[0].wind.speed


            // Transfer content to HTML and append to appropriate DOM element

            let cityH2 = $("<h2 class='cityCl'>").text(cityName);
            let citeDate = $("<p class='datecl'>").text(today);
            let weatherIcon = $("<img src='https://openweathermap.org/img/wn/" + response.list[0].weather[0].icon + ".png'>");
            let pOne = $("<p>").text("temperature:  " + temperature + " Â°F");
            let pTwo = $("<p>").text("Humidity:  " + humidity + " %");
            let pThree = $("<p>").text("Wind Speed:  " + windSpeed + " MPH");

            // show media content that was hidden for a clean looking UI

            $(".media").show();

            //empty media body to replace with new appends

            $(".media-body").empty();
            $(".media-body").append(cityH2, citeDate, weatherIcon, pOne, pTwo, pThree);
